## Current version: v12.0 (2026-10-05)

Released: the v12 Windows zip, and the code pushed to GitHub on branch `claude/ecstatic-maxwell-eersoc` (v11.0 and earlier are on `claude/project-thread-7oz85t`; main still has v7.0). The all-versions zip lives outside this cloud session and wasn't updated for v12.

## Version history

- v1: single-player FPS.
- v2: multiplayer wave survival (host and join).
- v3:
  - Menus, characters, abilities and levels.
  - Mystery box, perks and extraction.
  - 3 maps and gun skins.
- v4:
  - Gun and hand models, and cast modes.
  - Prop-built maps.
  - Per-gun skins and crates.
- v5:
  - 5 characters on a jointed rig, emotes and pings.
  - Aim down sights and box attachments.
  - Door-locked areas, wall guns and night mode.
- v6:
  - Audio with volume groups, melee, hit markers, crawlers and death animations.
  - New zombie models, per-gun recoil and real attachment effects.
  - Valkyrie, plus ability animations and auras.
  - Walk-through buildings between areas.
  - Career unlocks and loadouts, an attachment guide and sandbox mode.
  - Click-to-reveal public IP and working graphics settings.
  - Code split into folders.
- v7:
  - Character levels (1-10, XP per character) unlocking 4 new abilities each at levels 2, 4, 6 (ultimate) and 8; pick 2 abilities and an ultimate on the Characters screen. 42 abilities in all, with new projectiles, gadgets and effects (`sim/powers.rs`, `fx/spells.rs`, `models/projectiles.rs`).
  - Iaido is a charged cast: hold to draw, release to send a flying crescent (12-40 m by charge).
  - Gun Crates (opening) and a Gun Skins tab (pick a gun, put any fitting skin on it). Any "all guns" finish can now go on a single gun.
  - Twin Fangs fire both SMGs every shot.
  - All three maps rebuilt from rooms, corridors and buildings with 7 door areas each (`maps/interiors.rs` floor-plan kit); `cargo test` checks every map connects.
  - Spawns face the most open direction.
- v8: art pass towards a painted look (numbers in `docs/art-direction.md`).
  - AgX tone mapping, softer grading, a warm sun with a cool fill, a gradient sky with a sun disc, and fog that matches the horizon.
  - A painted material on everything: brush grain, cool shadows and a soft rim light (`painted.rs`).
  - Realistic proportions for heroes and zombies, with tapered limbs and faces.
  - Pencil outlines on characters, guns and nearby props (`outline.rs`).
  - Painted ground markers for ability previews and enemy warnings (`markers.rs`). Brutes now wind up for 0.45 s before slamming.
  - A warm fading hit flash, camera shake, air particles per map, and an effects warm-up at match start (`feel.rs`).
  - New Graphics settings for outlines, camera shake and air particles.
  - `rust-fps lookdev` views for checking the art (`lookdev.rs`).
- v6.1: Ctrl+V pastes into the join address box (it used to type a "v", which made Windows report os error 11001), typed addresses are tidied (spaces, http://, commas), and clearer join errors.
- v8.1 (first step of the Game Overhaul list): power-ups drop half as often (3% a kill) and never within 25 s of the last drop; every ability cooldown is 30% longer (`COOLDOWN_SCALE` in `data.rs`).
- v9 (Game Overhaul part 2, the run):
  - A match is a run of 5 maps (`STAGES`, `ROUNDS_PER_STAGE` = 4 in `data.rs`): 4 rounds, then a boss; killing it opens a teleporter at the old extraction spot, and the whole team standing in it for 3 s moves everyone to the next map (`teleporter`, `next_stage` in `sim/mod.rs`). Maps go in order from the picked one; maps 4-5 flip day/night. Map 5's boss is the final boss; killing it wins the run (`MatchState::won`, was `extracted`).
  - Travel: `game.rs` watches `MatchState::stage` and passes through `AppState::Travel` for a frame, so the match is rebuilt on the new map on host and clients alike.
  - Bosses: `NetKind::Boss(0|1)`, a scaled, tinted Brute rig with a glow. Slam (`slam_spec`), fireball fans, summons at 2/3 and 1/3 health, final boss enrages under 30%. Immune to Insta-Kill, Nuke and crawling; 15% of stuns; knife does 1% instead of 20%. HP 35x (final 70x) a grunt, +75% per extra player. Boss bar on the HUD.
  - Doors are gone: every area is open, `DoorDef` is just a doorway cut in the walls; `strips.rs` only spawns wall guns. Zombies spawn anywhere.
  - Harder per map: zombie hits +15% per map, more Brutes and Shooters.
  - Level-up picks every 2 levels and after each boss; new stat upgrades (`data::Stat`: Vitality, Firepower, Focus, Swift, Sleight of Hand, 5 stacks each).
  - Career XP: 150/round, 3/kill, 400/map cleared, 1500 for a win. "Extractions" on the menu became "Runs won" (same save field).
  - Sandbox F1 panel can spawn a map boss or the final boss.
- v10 (Game Overhaul part 3, classes):
  - Each character is a class with 2 primaries and 2 secondaries (`Character::guns` in `data.rs`). You bring one of each (`PlayerInfo::class_guns`, saved per class in `Profile::class_guns`, attachments per gun in `Profile::gun_attach`) and start with both. The old single loadout gun, its wall board and `apply_loadouts` are gone.
  - Two weapon abilities per class on keys 3 and 4 (`WeaponAbility`, `GunBuff`, `PlayerAction::WeaponAbility`): a timed buff on your guns (elements, damage, fire rate, free ammo, stun, execute, blast, chain). Host checks `weapon_cd`; `resolve_shots` applies the buff.
  - Alternate fire on right mouse (`AltFire`, `alt_fire(gun)`): rifles fire an underbarrel grenade (8 s recharge, `grenade_cd`), shotguns a slug (one pellet worth the whole spread x0.9), SMGs and pistols a 5 or 3 shot burst. Snipers, DMRs, semi rifles and LMGs keep aim down sights. `Shot::alt` marks slug and grenade shots.
  - Weapon upgrades in level-up picks (`Upgrade::Weapon`, `gun_tiers`, up to Mk IV: +25% damage and magazine each).
  - The mystery box is the Armory: 750 for new random attachments on the gun in your hands, or a 5% wonder weapon (`roll_armory`). Wall boards are ammo caches (300, refill both guns).
  - Career unlocks cut to 16 levels: attachments and each class's second gun (`progression.rs`). Old career levels just mean more is unlocked.
  - Loadout screen rewritten: class guns in two columns with attachment pickers.
- v11 (Game Overhaul part 4, scaling ability upgrades):
  - `MAX_TIER` 3 to 5 (tier VI on the HUD); `Ability::cooldown` floors at 40% of the base.
  - Augments (`data::Augment`, `Upgrade::Augment`, `PlayerInfo::augments`, `MAX_AUGMENT` = 3) for the two abilities. `Ability::augment()` says which: Charges (dashes, leaps, Stim, Dome, Supply Drop) or Copies (everything else).
  - Charges: `PlayerInfo::charges`; `cooldowns[s]` is now the time to the next charge, refilled in `player_timers`. Clients check `charges > 0`.
  - Copies: the host calls `powers::cast` once per copy with the aim turned by `COPY_SPREAD` (0.2 rad) steps either side. Self-centred abilities just stack.
  - Zombie health +10% per map (`spawn_zombie`).
- v12 (Game Overhaul part 5, new classes):
  - Six classes replace the old ones: Bulwark, Medic, Revenant, Demolisher, Chemist and Ranger (`Character` in `data.rs`; serde aliases carry old saves over). New hero models in `rig/heroes.rs`.
  - 30 new abilities, 5 per class: two abilities and an ultimate at level 1, an ability at 3 and an ultimate at 6 (`Ability`, `ABILITY_DEFS`). Host logic in `sim/powers.rs`: thrown gadgets (`GrenadeBrain`, `Nade`), claymores and bear traps (`MineBrain`), the med drone and Army of the Dead warriors (`TurretBrain`), delayed strikes, pull/push `Forces`, and zones (`powers::zone`: Fortress, heal, fire, Reaper, acid, toxic, Plague Bloom, which grows).
  - Zombie status effects: poison, Hunter's Mark (+50% damage taken) and drain healing (`powers::effect` bits in the damage element mask).
  - Looks: one-shot ability effects in `fx/spells.rs` (`Fx::Spell`: pos/dir/size meaning is written in `cast()`), things falling from the sky (`Fx::Falling`), zone visuals in `fx/mod.rs` (`zone_fx`; Reaper's whirling scythes are `Scythe` children; Catalyst ends zones early with `Fx::ZoneEnd`). Auras stay lit for Chain Reaction, Rally Cry and Fortress.
  - First person: the left hand holds the real gadget models (`projectiles::missile_kit`, the drone), and the Revenant swings a two-handed scythe for Scythe Sweep and Reaper (`viewmodel.rs`).
  - Gadget models in `models/projectiles.rs`, warrior and drone in `models/avatars.rs`. `PROTOCOL_VERSION` 12.

## Known issues and loose ends

- The public IP lookup (api.ipify.org, then checkip.amazonaws.com, then icanhazip.com) could only be tested against a fake service. Check it on a real PC.
- Multiplayer has only been tested on one machine running several copies of the game.
- Ambient effects the host sends out (bullet tracers, explosions) ride in fire-and-forget snapshots, while important match events and effects (pings, power-up pickups, boss phases/down) ride in a reliable sequenced acknowledgement queue until confirmed.
- Sandbox spawns ignore walls: zombies always appear 9 m in front of you, even if that's inside a wall. With the indoor maps this happens more often.
- v7 abilities were only tested solo under lavapipe (2 fps). Their balance (damage, cooldowns) is a first pass and untested in co-op.
- The new maps haven't been played on a real GPU; map 2 has about 47 lights.
- Soft corner shading (SSAO) is untested on real GPUs.
- The v8 look was only seen under lavapipe, which bands colours. The painted shader, outlines and markers haven't been checked for speed on a real GPU.
- Camera shake and the hit flash were only checked in code; they can't be judged at 2 fps.
- v9 bosses were tested under lavapipe with test hooks (tiny boss health); their real health, damage and the summon counts are a first pass and need playing on a real PC, solo and in co-op.
- A full 5-map run hasn't been played start to finish; the stages were tested by jumping straight to boss rounds.
- Old "Extractions" from earlier versions count as "Runs won" on the main menu.
- v10 weapon abilities, alt fire and the Armory were checked solo under lavapipe (buff timer, grenade and its recharge, loadout screen). Balance (buff numbers, grenade damage, slug damage, Armory price) is a first pass. Not yet tested in co-op.
- Assault rifles lost aim down sights to the grenade; the Falcon AR still shows its built-in scope.
- v11 augments were tested with a hook giving full augments (4 fanned grenades, 4 dash charges). Copies of self-centred abilities (Frost Nova, Thunder Clap, Heal Pulse) simply stack their damage or healing; the aiming preview still shows one copy. Balance untested.
- v12 abilities were each cast once, solo, under lavapipe at about 2 fps, with a test hook that put every ability in turn into slot 1 and cast it at spawned zombies. Every one goes off with its look, but the numbers (first guesses plus one balance pass: Fortress burn 60 to 80, Earthshaker waves 450 to 700, Healing Grenade mist 12 to 8 a tick, Scythe Sweep 110 to 140, Toxic Cloud 20 to 28 a tick, Arrow Storm 36 arrows of 260 to 48 of 420) haven't been played properly, solo or in co-op. Resurrection could only be tested solo (no one to revive). Augmented copies of v12 abilities weren't tried.
- The first-person scythe swing and the held gadgets (canister, sticky bomb, flask, trap, claymore, dart, drone) were checked at 2 fps; their exact angles and sizes in the hand may want tweaking on a real PC.
- The six v12 hero models were checked in the lookdev lineup, side and heads views. The Ranger's mantle and hood were fixed; the others are as first built.

## Ideas not done yet

- Game Overhaul plan still to do: v13 procedural maps plus 10 more map themes, v14 sound design and a menu rework (bigger text).

- Part 7 of the art brief: skin rarity looks (a different finish per rarity).
- Jonah likes big maps with many rooms to traverse and explore; keep new maps that way.
- [Done] Resend important effects and match events (pings, power-up pickups, revives, boss events) until clients confirm them.
- More loadout slots (a second gun, a perk).
- Show a 3D preview of a newly unlocked gun on the end screen (it only lists the name now).

## Next session

- v12.1 overhaul (Audio, Feel, UI, Engine, Net):
  - Engine & compiler: added `#![recursion_limit = "256"]` in `main.rs` to fix trait recursion warning; removed deprecated legacy effects `Fx::Spear`, `Fx::Beam`, `Fx::Nova`, `Fx::Cone` and obsolete mesh builders (`Pending`, `spear_kit`).
  - Audio synthesis: added procedural sub-bass thump (`90 Hz -> 35 Hz`) for visceral explosions, slams, and heavy gunfire; added crisp metallic high-frequency headshot/crit ding; added dedicated `Snd::Slam` category.
  - Gunplay & Combat Feel: dynamic reticle bloom expanding on weapon spray and movement velocity; distinctive amber/golden headshot hitmarkers with enlarged ticks; smoothed weapon recoil recovery; added micro-stagger/flinch velocity dampening on zombies hit with heavy damage (>= 75 dmg, or headshots >= 40 dmg).
  - CoD Zombie Animation Overhaul:
    - Speed-adaptive gaits in `src/rig/mod.rs` (`zombie_pose`): terrifying asymmetrical dragging limp with erratic hunched sway, grotesque twitching head spasms, and hungry claw-reaching hands at walking speeds (< 3.0 m/s); aggressive 37° forward-leaning rabid sprints with violently pumping claw arms and rapid driving strides at high speeds.
    - Aggressive cycling attack variants in `src/rig/mod.rs` & `src/zombies.rs`: right-hand claw swipe, left hook claw slash, and lunging two-handed grapple biting strike.
    - Visceral ballistic hit flinch: violent head snap-back, spine rotation twisting away from bullet entry angles, buckling pelvis, and ballistic arm jolts.
    - Explosive CoD-style death crumples in `death_pose`: ballistic knockback slamming onto back with muscle twitches, instant knee-buckling headshot faceplants, and momentum-driven spin crumples.
  - CoD Gunshot Audio & On-Hit Audio Synthesis:
    - 4-stage gunshot physical synthesis in `src/audio/synth.rs`: supersonic crack and mechanical action snap transient, saturated concussive bark body (`tanh` soft-clipping), visceral pitch-dropping sub-bass thump, and multi-tap spatial reverberation tail.
    - Iconic weapon profiles: M1911 pistol action crack, Magnum hand-cannon roar with metallic ringing, Shotgun close-range wallop with 92Hz sub-kick, Assault Rifle staccato bark, SMG rapid muzzle snap, and high-caliber Sniper rifle thunder.
    - Tactile CoD on-hit feedback: meaty low-mid flesh squelch and crisp mechanical 'thwip/tick' hitmarker (`HitTick`), iconic skull-pop bone fracture crunch with bell overtone confirmation (`HitHead`), heavy bone-crushing kill finish (`Kill`), and fleshy bullet squelches layered into zombie hurt audio.
  - CoD On-Hit & Visual Gore Overhaul:
    - Directional blood splatter and flesh spray on every bullet and damage impact in `src/fx/mod.rs` (`Fx::Blood`). Visceral crimson blood material (`Color::srgb(0.55, 0.03, 0.03)` with wet specular shine and subtle luminescence), expanding blood mist, flesh gore chunks, and tumbling bone chips.
    - Dramatic headshot gore burst with expanding red mist spheres, high-velocity arterial droplet arcs, shattering skull bone fragments, crimson point light flash, and lasting ground blood puddles (`Grow::Hold`).
    - Decapitation blood fountain on fatal headshots: arterial blood geyser and high-pressure spurts jetting upward from the severed neck with vertebrae splinters, flesh chunks, and pooling blood (`Fx::Decapitation`).
    - Subtle visceral camera punch on nearby headshot crits and decapitations in `src/feel.rs`, plus full shader pre-warming in `warm_up()`.
    - CoD Zombies style hitmarker in `src/hud.rs`: 4 sharp diagonal ticks snapping dynamically outward/inward, crisp silver ticks with central red flash on body hits, bold crimson-amber ticks with enlarged tick geometry on critical hits, and a prominent red kill confirmation flash on lethal eliminations.
  - UI & UX typography: added dynamic `ui_scale` in settings (`0.8x..=1.5x`) with 100% backward-compatible config serialization; enlarged fonts, padding, and contrast across Main Menu, Lobby, Settings, Pause, and Loadout; expanded HUD round prompts, ammo readout, and boss health bar.
  - Network reliability: implemented reliable sequenced event acknowledgement queue over UDP for critical match events (pings, power-ups, player downs/revives, boss phases); bumped `PROTOCOL_VERSION` to 13.
